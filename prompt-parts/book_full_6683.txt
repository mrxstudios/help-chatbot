Wars, Lizards and Longhorns:
A Remembrance of Life in Old New Mexico
by Andrew Jackson Lunamos
25 December 1880
Santa Fe, New Mexico Territory
I, Andrew Jackson Lunamos, being of sound mind and body and no earthly possessions, am near the end of my life. I will to the town of Diamondback, New Mexico, its own story—heretofore known in full
to no one but me.

Chapter I
How I Got There or,
The Mad Monk of Santa Marta
I was born in New Orleans in 1815, of an American mother and a Spanish father who had fled the colonial authorities in Veracruz following a tax dispute. He became a blacksmith and opened his store on Bourbon Street. My mother died of yellow fever the same year as the Mexican Revolution of 1821, and my father brought me to what is now the American territory of New Mexico. I was only a child of 6 when Father brought me to this spot near the Hurache range just west of the Rio Grande, to a location he'd seen only once before on a map belonging to the infamous French pirate Jean Lafitte.
My father fought with Lafitte during the siege of New Orleans. One night during the siege, a drunk Lafitte showed my father his greatest secret—an old treasure map which indicated a trove of Spanish silver clearly marked at this spot in the wilds of New Mexico. Lafitte was so convinced of the map's veracity that he intended to come explore the mine himself, but he never pulled himself away from the sea to venture into this arid, distant land.
Diamondback and its environs was Mexican then, for our arrival here followed independence from the Spanish. We followed the Rio Grande north through the desert, then turned left onto the Rio Gordo just north of Socorro. Here, not far from the sad little creek, we found the bone-littered ruin of a Spanish mission which stood alone here.
In 1821, the mission was deserted except for a strange old monk, a deaf mute named Jeromino. Writing in an old-fashioned Spanish script with an ink made from juniper berries, he informed us that he had been keeping the records of the Church of Santa Marta for over 100 years--he estimated his own age to be 138.
He prayed among the 150-year-old bones that still lay in the dust of the chapel floor. These were Spanish bones, some of the skulls still wearing their helmets, of men slaughtered by the Yunni Indians in the uprising of 1680. Jeromino said they had once been buried beneath the church's floor, as in a European abbey, but that by the 1790s, the floor had disintegrated, and the earth beneath dried and blew away. Jeromino took it as a sign from God and left them lying exposed in the dust.
For their part, the Indians, who remembered the Spanish massacre only by their legends, believed this mission to be haunted; and they believed Jeromino to be crazy.
Jeromino vanished only a few months after my father and I arrived here; we never learned what became of him, except that the number of bones in the chapel floor seemed to have increased. Perhaps that was only my imagination. Several years later another priest arrived. Father DeSilva made many improvements to the buildings and lived to a great age, succumbing at 76 years in 1872. The current overseer of Diamondback's spiritual needs is Father Diaz. A man of compassion, Diaz has recently arranged for the instruction of the Yunni children -- turning a storage area in the mission to a school room. The idea was not without controversy, especially among tribal elders who did not want their children taught White ways. After assurances from the Father, they relented however. Today the Yunni school is one of the finest example of cooperation between Anglo and native Americans that I can think of.
Chapter II
Silver and Dreams
A Father's Last Words
To those who speak Spanish, the valley of the Rio Gordo sounds like a paradise: the Fat River. Its banks have attracted, and disappointed, more than one settler. It was one of them, Guillermo Bolivar, the founder of Diamondback's venerable Bolivar clan, who gave the river its name. Not because the river itself was fat: it was not wide. I do not believe that it ever was. Bolivar named it the Fat River because the river had fat in it. When we first saw it, it had rained so little here that a thick scum had formed on the creek's surface, just like the lard rendered from one thousand hogs.
Life was never easy for us. We lived on reptiles and juniper berries. The Bolivars, who owned a small ranch by the river, showed us great kindness. When we could, we searched among the ravines and plateaus of the nearby mountains for the silver mine my father had seen only once marked on a map, on a piece of parchment held by a drunken French outlaw on Rampart Street, so long ago.
Perhaps my father was crazy with the heat, all these long days spent among the rocks, beneath the sun. He suffered long spells of brooding silence, preoccupied with the mission and Jeromino's records, even going so far as making long berry-ink copies of some of the books of the Apocrypha.
The Mexican-American War of 1846 ended his search. Upon hearing that the same men he had fought beside in New Orleans 30 years before were now invading his beloved Mexico, my father took ill. He died, suffering hallucinations of both heaven and silver, saying he would soon possess the treasure he had sought his whole life, "to share it only with the ancient Spaniards."
I buried my father in the dusty graveyard of the mission, and vowed that I would never suffer such delusions. I put aside the search for the old man's tragic fantasy and have not carried a pick since the day. I was of fighting age, but I did not go to war. I marked my father's grave and went into the mountains, because I knew nothing else. From the Indians I heard rumors about what was happening—massacres upriver, down river, massacres of Mexicans by Americans, massacres of Americans by Mexicans. I was prepared to ally myself with whomever I met, to treat either the Americans or Mexicans as long-lost brothers.
Chapter III
A Town Is Founded
Diamondback It Is!
I found out about the Treaty of Guadelupe-Hidalgo in 1848, of how the whole of this land now belonged to President Polk and the United States of America, when I saw men on horses encamped along the Rio Gordo. The riders wore blue coats and shiny buttons and were more white people than I had seen since I was a small child in New Orleans. They asked me in English where the nearest town was. And full of mischief toward these people who had defeated my father's country, I replied in my mother's tongue, pointing them in the direction of the mission and graveyard—a village of ghosts and bones.
They followed my directions and went there, but they never did understand my joke, because they stayed there, a night, a fortnight, a month of Sundays. Under the direction of Colonel Samson Macintosh, the man I thought I fooled, the soldiers put a town in the shadow of Santa Marta. The men called it Depot Gordo and built an army livery, a dispensary, an army headquarters, and a saloon, called "Neely's" after its proprietor, Jack Neely, a retired cattle rustler if rumors are believed.
The army left in 1850, though several men remained. For a week or two I thought things would return to the dry, almost deserted Rio Gordo Valley as my father and I had known it. But I kept seeing more and more white strangers, most of them headed west, here for a night or two, just long enough to keep the saloon and its upstairs enjoyments in business. One man even made a hotel by erecting a canvas tent in an area we soon took to calling Main Street.
The hotelier's name was Skiz Sheraton. An energetic man, Skiz said the demand for hostelries was so strong he could erect his tent in a cactus bed, charge a nickel a piece for the pleasure of doing so and see a booming business. His idle boast became a reality in the Cactus Bed, the modern hotel which now graces the original site.
Skiz's tent was often full up. These travelers, '49ers we called them, paid Skiz, Skiz paid carpenters to keep expanding his business, carpenters bought nails from Diego Bolivar, a hardware man, Diego Bolivar paid the saloonkeeper, and soon word got out that here in Depot Gordo could be found entertainment and relief from the heat.
On any given day, most of the people in town were visitors who'd never been here day before yesterday and might never be here again the day after tomorrow. Since such transients kept us in business, we couldn't afford to be critical. But as more people started coming through, the small but growing business community expressed dissatisfaction with the town's name. Santiago Bolivar, the father of Diego, organized the first town meeting. A Council of Nomenclature was created to bestow a new name upon Depot Gordo. Harold Seeder proposed "Gila" because, of all the creatures in the desert, that lizard seemed most likely to survive. John Belcher nominated "Cottonmouth," because that was the most common sensation on mornings here following, as all mornings did in those days, a night spent at Neely's Saloon. But it was Tarleton Sloughwater who came up with our current name. The diamondback rattlesnake, he said, seeks shade and sleep, also popular past times amongst our two-legged inhabitants. After weeks of argument, "Diamondback" became a general favorite as the proposal seemed the least likely to cause problems in the future
When we finally got a post office in 1859—a Pony Express drop-off, to be more precise, though they didn't use real ponies, and it wasn't really an express because messengers were more likely to use mules, and once, a cow—Diamondback was what the United States Post Office called us. So Diamondback is what we remained.
Chapter IV
Forty-Niners in the Fifties
Pioneers Put Down Roots
Among those who arrived in the 1850s were Nate Trotter and his brother, Jake. They were among the few who actually found some gold in California. They were on their way home to Missouri, but when they were watering their horses in the Rio Gordo and themselves in the saloon, Nate read a two-month-old newspaper about John Brown, the killings in Kansas, and the likelihood of war. They chose to stop here and wait for things to cool off back East. Of course, things didn't begin to cool off for more than a decade, and by then the Trotters were settled, making a living on their Double Speed Ranch, outside of town.
Another arrival in the 1850s was Cosimo Macintosh, young son and heir of Samson Macintosh. He was here as a young orderly back in the '40s, arrogant because of his father's power in the community, audacious, shameless. He took what he wanted, whether it was a girl, or a bottle, or an advantage over a neighbor. He left with his father in 1850, but his fortunes apparently didn't carry over into Chicago, where we heard they had moved; the younger Macintosh was back three years later, wearing a U.S. colonel's uniform. He apparently intimidated enough people with it to claim some land along the Rio Gordo "on behalf of President Pierce and the U.S. Government"; obtained a permanent tab at the saloon by threatening to close it down for violations of federal regulations he pointed to in a book he never allowed any of us to read; and seized a wife, Hassie, who I think was impressed with his uniform.
By the time rumors spread that Colonel Macintosh wasn't even a U.S. officer, that he had stolen the uniform from his father and had, in fact, been court-martialed as an enlisted man during the Indian campaigns in Utah, for impersonating an officer--well, by then, Cosimo Macintosh was so well ensconced in our tiny economy there was little we could do about it.
Chapter V
Sacks of Sweet Salvation
The Rush for Moron's Silver
Traffic had begun to dwindle toward the late '50s, but by then we were seeing some of the same faces, coming back from the direction in which we'd seen them disappear, years earlier: ranchers, hunters, even a handful of prospectors. Most of these were on their way back from California, disappointed at what they'd found at Comstock's Lode.
In 1859, for the first time since my father had told it to me, I heard stories of the "Devil's Breath", the lost silver mine. For two years, prospectors came here, not on their way somewhere else, but to Diamondback, to look for silver. Sometimes they proudly brought canvas pokes full of shiny rocks into town and attempted to sell them to Diego Bolivar. Invariably, he smiled and informed these innocents that they'd spent the last weeks or months mining iron pyrite. Fool's Gold. There is no word for those who mistake fool's gold for silver. But in Diamondback, iron pyrite became known as Moron's Silver.
These rocks contributed to our economy so significantly that the saloon offered specials on pyrite--one free glass of redeye for a 100-pound sack of Moron's Silver. These greenhorn prospectors were so distraught about their wasted labor that they generally spent the balance of their savings on whiskey. The town's economy owed so much to the mineral that we considered renaming the town Pyropolis, but we feared it might give too many people the right idea about the mining fortunes hereabouts.
Meanwhile, the saloon built the fanciest privy in the territory, all but the seats constructed of shiny pyrite obtained from that whiskey offer. You can still see it today behind the Hard Drive, although prospectors have carried away the better part of it.
Chapter VI
"The Dry Belch of War"
The North-South Conflict in Diamondback
The Pyrite Rush didn't last long. In 1861, the Confederate states seceded. The People of Diamondback in the Territory of New Mexico were remote from the organized states in many respects, and many expected this Easterners' war to pass them by. Africans were not strangers to Diamondback. Some had passed through here as free men, some in the tow of westbound prospectors. Others were runaways that had chosen to take their chances with the Apaches and the rattlers in the West rather than risk the vicissitudes of the slave-return laws up in the North. But New Mexicans had no laws about slavery—it was neither legal nor illegal here. Most of us in Diamondback thought it a repugnant institution.
Yet, in the summer of 1861, the Confederate States of America declared Diamondback to be part of the Confederacy. Or so we thought they did. Late that year, Confederate General Sibley came from Texas. In December, he arrived down in Mesilla.
The people of Socorro County knew and respected General Sibley. Before the war, he'd whipped the Seminoles and the Utah Mormons both. When he captured Albuquerque and declared that everything south of the 34th parallel was Confederate, Diamondbackers were disinclined to argue.
Diamondback had forgotten war. The soldiers who first came here in the Mexican War were long gone. Some left west, others left east, some in army convoys, some on stolen horses. Some who drank too much stayed here, of course, but since they didn't often wear their blue uniforms anymore, we no longer thought of them as soldiers. Now Diamondback was saddled beneath another national government. The old one never meant much to us, and we were confident that this new one would mean just as little.
In the saloons at night one could hear drunken men singing "Dixie," though they never did get the words just right. Some had been out on this side of the Pecos for so long they weren't sure exactly where Dixie Land was—Baja California, some said. The Yucatan, said others. But they sang the songs, and some even sewed rebel flags onto their sombreros, drawn from memory of the Taggert boys who had seen a Confederate outfit taking off toward Valverde--though they didn't get those flag designs exactly right, either. Some of them looked more like British Union Jacks.
Diamondbackers were surprised to see the Stars and Stripes again in the summer of 1862 when a surveyor from El Paso arrived on horseback and told the citizens that they were wrong about the town's latitude. Diamondback was actually a few miles north of the 34th parallel; and Union troops were driving General Sibley out of New Mexico, anyway. We had heard little about the war except from scarcely believable stories told by deserters on their way to California. But suddenly a Union army arrived from the west. Calling themselves the California Column, this Union army swept from the west to the east. For many here, the martial law established by Union General Carleton was their first taste of federal government. We liked it very little. But we named one of our streets Grant Street, after the Union hero of Vicksburg.
One detachment of the California Column, led by a Union colonel named Kit Carson, camped in Diamondback for a few weeks. Everyone liked Carson well enough. We called him "Rope Thrower," just like the Navaho did. Because the old adobe-style houses were much stouter than the flimsy buildings we'd put up in the last 20 years, Carson decided to use them as an ammunition supply depot. He commandeered Santiago Bolivar's store and several other private residences.
These munitions were not for use against the Confederates, apparently, because they'd already retreated to Texas. In the absence of the Confederate Army, these New Mexico Yankees, lonely for enemies to fight, found Indians. Carson didn't like it, but he followed orders, making raids against the Yunni, Navahos and Apaches, scattering them with his firepower.
On March 29, 1864, Kit Carson's artillery magazine in Diamondback blew up, destroying Main Street's only adobe structures. Whether the blast was as an act of God, a saboteur from the Yunni or Apache nations—or a townsman tired of having to live under organized government—remains one of the many mysteries of our town. In any case, the Union Army's interest in Diamondback ended with that gunpowder magazine. "The dry belch of war," said Santiago Bolivar. Carson left, What was Main Street lay in ruins.
We heard about the Civil War's end only by hearsay, some of us having difficulty recalling which side was which. When we heard of the Appomattox surrender in the late spring of 18865, we lined Grant Street with colorful broken glass from the saloon. But several weeks later, we received news of the last-ditch Confederate victory at Palmito Ranch on the Rio Grande in Texas. Anticipating a renewed rebel sweep much closer to home, Diamondback hastily named a cross street after General Lee.
Chapter VII
The Great Plod West
Diamondback's Domesticity
After the war, more and more travelers came through. As before, many of them desperadoes and fortune-hunters, deserters and war criminals—-but now there were also doctors, accountants, mothers with children. Very few of them stayed here for long before moving farther west, to Tombstone or Virginia City or even San Francisco. Still, they brought work, and money, and news of the world beyond the Pecos.
To peddle that news, a newspaperman from east Texas named Chesterfield Leonidas Philippeau arrived in 1866 and began publishing a monthly news sheet called the Diamondback Rattler. Such is the nature of this town of bad spellers that we shortened his name to Chet Flippo, and it stuck. We were grateful that in the early days, he drew pictures of the news for us to help us understand things like "radical reconstruction" and "manifest destiny" and "impeachment." I am not sure any of us followed it, but we enjoyed the pictures, anyway. It was from Mr. Flippo that we heard that Napoleon III made the Austrian Archduke Maximillian the new Emperor of Mexico. Flippo drew a world map with lines connecting this odd-looking character with a feathered hat on a throne in France, from thence to another character with epaulets and medals in Austria, then across the Atlantic Ocean to another throne in Mexico. John Belcher and his sons never believed any of it, but all of Diamondback appreciated Flippo's imagination.
Observant visitors may discern that Flippo has a pronounced limp in his right leg. That came in 1869, as the result of a violent confrontation with Charles Finnie, the editor of the Trumpeter in Dry Rot, not 16 miles from Diamondback, who accused Flippo of slander over some exaggerations the Rattler had printed on the origin and nature of Dry Rot. The two met to have it out at the Belcher Ranch. Facing each other, they began firing and emptied four six-guns without hitting anything but three skinny steers who had wandered into their sights. (The editors, after years spent reading newsprint, had difficulty discerning anything beyond their type boxes.) In frustration Finnie tipped an elderly milk cow over onto Flippo, pulling his hip out of socket. Flippo has never fully recovered, and still has difficulty with that leg, though he doesn't like to talk about it.
The two journalists have never gotten along since, and seem predictably to take opposite sides of every issue. To get an accurate picture of everything from pork futures to the Franco-Prussian War, they say, one must read both the Rattler and the Trumpeter.
Chapter VIII
Bovine Brawlings
The Struggle for Land
For almost a decade the pyrite mine had brought people and money to Diamondback. For those who owned the saloon and the dry-goods store and the bank, of course, these sacks of moron's silver became genuine silver and gold in the form of U.S. dollars and double eagles. Santiago Bolivar, who had operated a hardware depot since the days of the Rush, expanded his dry-goods business. His son Diego now managed the store while Santiago retired to make modest improvements on his cattle ranch on the Rio Gordo, located downstream from town. Diamondback's effluence had fertilized the soil and, at least on his side of the Gordo, seemed to make the ground more fruitful than it had ever been before.
In the summer of '71 his crops began dying. Bolivar learned that the Belchers had dammed the Gordo at their property upstream, diverting its scarce water to their cattle, then running whatever remained into the desert to allow it to evaporate and disappear. They saw any competition as a threat to their cattle market. Bolivar complained to the Belchers. Two days later he was found on his property, drowned in the nine-inch puddle the Gordo had become.
The people of Diamondback had never been interested in an organized, elected city government before—we had always counted on Diego Bolivar to take the necessary initiatives. Following Bolivar's death, Cosimo Macintosh argued the need for political administration. He staged what many called a municipal coup and became, in effect, the town's "mayor." Macintosh counts the ballots every two years, and there are those who claim he's never gotten a popular vote outside of the one he casts himself. He remains mayor today. The murderer of Santiago Bolivar was never found.
Chapter IX
The Lawless Years
A Royal Flush of Rogues
The combination of Diamondback's freedom from laws and its wealth attracted the great desperadoes of the day: Billy the Kid, Russian Bill, the Apache Kid, Joe Fowler: all of them were familiars at the Neely's establishment. An occasional lynching kept things in line—though whose line, we were never certain. It changed from week to week, and as long as we minded our own business and kept the liquor flowing, we appeared to be safe. We knew only that we were living better than we ever had, and when one group of strangers hanged another group of strangers from the cottonwood tree in Santa Marta's cemetery, we waited until they'd dried out—it usually took only a good, cloudless afternoon—and then cut them down to keep from scaring new customers. We buried most of the bodies on a sand dune called Doc Martin's Hill.
From 1865 until 1873, Diamondback boomed as it never had before, and we thought it would last forever.
That was before one card game at Neely's Saloon got out of hand.
By the summer of 1873, the pyrite craze had pretty much run its course. Some entrepreneurs here feared that after 15 years the crowds would soon thin out some, and with them, Diamondback's slim livelihood. To insure that some travelers would keep riding into town and keep buying redeye at Neely's Saloon, the establishment began hosting territorial poker championships. On the first—and only—day of this event—July 27, 1873, at about noon, 16 desperadoes gathered at Neely's for the long-anticipated gambling Olympiad. Among them were Russian Bill, Bonehead Hawkins, One-Eyed Annie, the Apache Kid, Black Bertrand, El Paso Patsy, Doc Yesterday, Bucketfoot Laroo, Horsehide Henry, Lonesome Jones, Seven Shooter, Pumpkin Boy, Quick Silverfoot, Colonel Leonidas Beaujolais Johnston, Coyote-Who-Eats-His-Toads-By-Moonlight, and one man known to us only as Greg. Each contestant was accompanied by a second, well armed and ready to offer valuable advice on the gentleman's game of five card stud.
Just past two, a fine dinner of pan-fried jackrabbit and cactus stew was cleared from the card tables, when Russian Bill looked across the table at his partner, Doc Yesterday, and said something no one quite understood. To most of us, it sounded like Russian, but Jack Neely swore he heard something about "rabbit grease on the hearts."
Apparently convinced that everyone present was conspiring against him, he pulled out two revolvers and shot his partners, his opponents, his seconds, and everyone else at the table—before any player had an opportunity to put down his cards. Then Russian Bill re-loaded and killed several witnesses, as well.
Things got ugly after that. In the confusion that followed, a barroom fight over whose bloody, bullet-perforated cards were whose and who actually won the poker championship, became a riot that became a small war. By the end of the week, the poor little town of Diamondback was closed down, its bank looted, its cattle eaten, its women stolen, its whiskey drunk, its shells spent. Neely's was closed for good.
We understood only then the purpose of government, and when President Grant sent a U.S. marshall to us, we did not resist the order. However, this new marshall did. Marshall Evander Law vanished after two weeks here. Then, another who was sent to find him, Marshall Art Saccademi. He, too, vanished. Then another, Marshall Brady, vanished—after only six hours in Diamondback.
We first thought, of course, that it was the work of rustlers, that our brave marshalls had been kidnapped and lynched, perhaps thrown into the Rio Gordo in the dark. Indeed, the familiar scum on the river's surface seemed thicker than it had been before. But within a few weeks, we heard someone had seen Marshall Brady in Albuquerque at the Centennial Fourth of July parade in '76. We soon learned that all of our marshalls were there. They went on to found their own baseball team, the Albuquerque Marshalls. But only five of them were actual U.S. marshalls. Two were sheriffs, one was a deputy, another a jailer.
Chapter X
Be Brave, the Future
Diamondback Meets Her Destiny
Diamondback nearly died out altogether after the gunfight in '73. Even the purchase of Neely's by Oona Canute, a well-traveled woman recently of Shanghai, China, would not turn the tide. When Miss Canute's wagon broke down in front of the shuttered Neely's, a cowpoke asked, "Hard drive, ma'am?" "It is now," responded the enterprising Miss Canute who had seen the "For Sale" sign across the darkened windows. The rechristened Hard Drive Saloon was opened for business the next day.
It was the Lincoln County War two years ago that kept Diamondback in business. This war, or feud, between the ranchers in the county just to the east of us—really, it was a brawl with ammunition—got so hot in 1878 that people actually fled to Diamondback, preferring the silence of the Cactus Bed Hotel's lobby to the gunfire in Lincoln County. This was a new concept for us.
Diamondback was glad to see the refugees come, bringing money to spend in the saloon and the dry-goods store. Then more people from Lincoln County came to kill the refugees, and we were glad to see them come, too, because they brought money to spend at the saloon and the dry-goods store. The famous Lincoln County War was very good for Diamondback. We got to know the neighbors.
One of them was Billy the Kid, who came to town looking for the men who had killed his friend, the English cattleman John Henry Tunstall. Billy didn't find his men here—they'd left the day before—but Billy got silly drunk at the Hard Drive Saloon that night, then went upstairs with one of the larger girls. When she opened at noon the next day, Oona Canute announced in the bar that Billy was no longer a kid, said we should start calling him Bill the Hombre. But we already had an outlaw in town by that name and didn't want to make more trouble than we had already.
President Hayes declared that he'd no longer put up with the Lincoln County War. Lew Wallace, the Union general from the Battle of Shiloh and the new territorial governor of New Mexico, announced measures to suppress the violence.
Meanwhile, Diamondback continued to go about its business. A new sheriff was appointed by Mayor Macintosh, a Mr. William Purvis, who holds that post still. There was bitterness over the loss of the railroad route when it was announced by executives of the Pecos & Pacific Railroad that the tracks would run through Asbestos and Dry Rot instead of the more northerly route via Diamondback. The disappointment was mitigated somewhat by the opening of Watson's apothecary and the installation of a telegraph at the Southwestern stage office. The arrival of the town's first doctor, Miss Rodham of Whitewater, Arkansas, was met with near universal approval.
I am an old man now, and have seen much. Soon I shall be reunited with my beloved mother and father in that place of blessed peace and potable drinking water. Though few visitors wander into it, I feel certain, as my time on Earth draws nigh, that Diamondback, New Mexico, is at the dawning of a new age. Whether this new day will bring good or evil, I cannot predict. I know only what we have come to expect.
