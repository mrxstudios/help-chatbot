- Diamondback, New Mexico, is a town born from chaos, hardship, and survival. Andrew Jackson Lunamos, the chronicler of its history, recalls its beginnings. In 1821, Lunamos and his father arrived at the ruined Santa Marta Mission, which was haunted by the bones of Spanish settlers massacred during the Yunni uprising of 1680. A deaf-mute monk named Jeromino, claiming to be 138 years old, tended the mission until his mysterious disappearance. Lunamos's father spent years searching for treasure rumored to have been marked on a pirate map from Jean Lafitte, but he died delusional, believing he would find silver in the afterlife. The mission became the center of Diamondback's spiritual and social life, later transformed by priests like Father DeSilva and Father Diaz, who opened a school for Yunni children, fostering rare cooperation between Anglos and natives.
- In 1848, U.S. soldiers led by Colonel Samson Macintosh arrived, naming the area Depot Gordo. Under their influence, a saloon, hotel, and army headquarters were built. When the army left, the town grew around transient travelers and opportunists. A council eventually renamed the town Diamondback, inspired by the resilience of the diamondback rattlesnake. Early settlers included Santiago Bolivar, who established the first hardware store and cattle ranch, and Skiz Sheraton, whose "Cactus Bed" hotel catered to '49ers and other fortune-seekers passing through. These transient visitors shaped the town’s character, bringing money and chaos in equal measure.
- The Pyrite Rush of the 1850s brought prospectors in search of silver, though most found fool’s gold, known locally as "Moron’s Silver." Saloons traded whiskey for sacks of pyrite, fueling the local economy briefly. Even a privy was constructed from the shiny mineral. By 1861, the rush ended, and the town turned its attention to survival amid the Civil War. Confederate troops claimed the area in 1861, but Union forces led by Kit Carson occupied Diamondback in 1864. Carson's men used the adobe structures for munitions storage until a mysterious explosion destroyed Main Street, ending Union interest in the town. After the war, Diamondback renamed streets after Grant and Lee, hedging loyalties and highlighting its opportunistic nature.
- The Poker Massacre of 1873 marked one of Diamondback's darkest days. A territorial poker championship at Neely’s Saloon ended in bloodshed when Russian Bill, convinced of a conspiracy, shot his opponents and witnesses alike. The ensuing riot nearly destroyed the town. Lawlessness prevailed, with outlaws like Billy the Kid, Russian Bill, and others frequenting the saloon. Attempts to restore order failed spectacularly; several U.S. marshals vanished after arriving in town, only to later reappear as members of the Albuquerque Marshals baseball team.
- Diamondback was no stranger to intrigue and tragedy. Santiago Bolivar’s death in 1871, allegedly at the hands of the Belcher family over water rights, led to the rise of Colonel Cosimo Macintosh, who declared himself mayor. Bolivar’s contributions to the town, from his hardware store to his ranch, were overshadowed by Macintosh’s fraudulent rule. Despite the chaos, figures like Chesterfield Philippeau, a newspaperman, brought new life to the town with his Diamondback Rattler, though even he faced conflict, including a feud that left him permanently injured after a botched duel.
- The town's economy was briefly revived during the Lincoln County War of 1878, when refugees and their pursuers brought money to Diamondback’s businesses. Notable moments include the arrival of Oona Canute, who transformed the shuttered Neely’s Saloon into the Hard Drive, and the installation of the telegraph and the town’s first doctor, Miss Rodham. Despite the setbacks, Diamondback persisted, surviving on the resilience and opportunism of its residents. It remains a testament to the absurdity and endurance of frontier life.
